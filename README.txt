3DBosey is the jolly, musical, 3D printing torture-test. Inspired by the most iconic and 
frequently-used test object for 3D printers, the 3DBenchy [http://www.3dbenchy.com], 
the 3DBosey offers the opportunity to test a 3D printer, while creating a useful, 
nautically-themed, high-quality speaker.

In the 3DBosey design, the BOSEbuild speaker cube takes up the cabin portion of the 
3DBenchy model. The top panel of the BOSEbuild speaker can be 3D printed in one part 
and is a useful test of a 3D printer's bridging performance. 

The bottom panel can be printed in two parts, to avoid an impossible-to-print large 
overhang. The first part is a square panel for the BOSEbuild speaker cube with holes 
for attaching the bottom part of the 3DBenchy. That bottom part has matching screw 
holes for attaching the hull portion of the boat to the speaker cube. The bottom 
portion of the print can be used to test a 3D printers resolution, surface finish, 
and dimensional accuracy.

The 3DBosey is the most musical way to torture (or calibrate) your 3D printer. Plus, 
by the time the print is done, you will have a decorative speaker with the unbeatable 
audio quality of Bose.
